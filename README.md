# Chrome Config

## user.js

- This should be placed in the profiles root directory (**eg** ...).
- This file has some parts I wrote (these parts:
        - make it so https doesn't default, not good practice
        - enable userChrome configuration
        -
        ) plus the whole of Betterfox
  (https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/tree/main)

## chromes

- `chrome_the_first` was clearly my first attempt something like this

### notes

- the profile root directory is where these files should be saved.
